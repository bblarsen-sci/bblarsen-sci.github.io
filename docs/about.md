    </div>
    <p>
        I am broadly interested in how viruses evolve in wild mammals, in particular bats and rodents. I am
        currently a postdoctoral fellow at the <a class="" href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html">Fred Hutch
            Cancer Center</a>, in Seattle, Washington, where
        I study the evolution of Nipah virus in the <a class=""
            href="https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html">Bloom lab</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I received my PhD in 2021 from the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, in the <a class="link"
            href="https://eeb.arizona.edu">Department of Ecology and
            Evolutionary Biology</a>. I worked with my PhD advisor, Dr. Michael Worobey, to study the evolution
        of paramyxoviruses in wild mammals and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as a research technician in the lab of <a class="link"
            href="https://mullinslab.microbiol.washington.edu/people/faculty/1460-James-Mullins">Dr. James
            Mullins</a> at the University of Washington. I contributed to projects involving sequencing HIV
        genomes from breakthrough infections in vaccine trials and early infection.
