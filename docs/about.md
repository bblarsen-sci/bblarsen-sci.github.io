                I am broadly interested in how viruses evolve in wild mammals, in particular bats and rodents. My research spans field work, experimental approaches using pseudotyped lentiviruses, and computational analyses. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html">Fred Hutch Cancer Center</a>, in Seattle, Washington, where I study the molecular and protein evolution of Nipah virus in the <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html">Bloom lab</a>.

                I received my PhD in 2021 from the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, from the <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://eeb.arizona.edu">Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a>. I worked with my PhD advisor, Dr. Michael Worobey, to study the evolution of paramyxoviruses in wild mammals and the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic.

                Prior to my PhD, I worked as a research technician in the lab of <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://mullinslab.microbiol.washington.edu/people/faculty/1460-James-Mullins">Dr. James Mullins</a> at the University of Washington, in Seattle, Washington. I worked on projects that involved sequencing HIV genomes from breakthrough infections in vaccine trials and early infection.
