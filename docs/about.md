            I am broadly interested in how viruses evolve in wild mammals. My research spans field work, experimental approaches using pseudotyped lentiviruses, and computational biology. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, in Seattle, Washington, where I study the evolution of Nipah virus in the Bloom lab.

            I received my PhD in 2021 from the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. I worked with my PhD advisor, Dr. Michael Worobey, to study the evolution of paramyxoviruses in wild mammals. I also worked with Dr. Worobey to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic.

            Prior to my PhD, I worked as a research technician in the lab of Dr. James Mullins at the University of Washington, in Seattle, Washington. I worked on projects that involved sequencing HIV genomes from breakthrough infections in vaccine trials and other settings.
