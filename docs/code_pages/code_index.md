# Posts about code
I primarily use Altair, D3, and ChimeraX to make visualizations. 

### D3
[D3](https://d3js.org/){target="_self"} is a library for creating interactive data visualizations in the browser. I will show how to use D3 with Vue.js to create interactive data visualizations. I plan on adding to this collection with additional examples in the future.

### ChimeraX
[ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/){target="_self"} is a powerful free software for visualizing protein structure data. I will show how to map deep mutational scanning data onto protein structures.

### Altair
[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/){target="_self"} is a python package for making interactive plots.
